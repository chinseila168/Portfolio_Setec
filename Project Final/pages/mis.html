        <p>
            The current era is the era of computers, and now this technology is widely used in various areas such
            as scientific, technical, trade, public administration services... When human society aims to improve,
            the information technology sector must grow in parallel. The growth of the use of information technology
            has rapidly expanded in the country as private institutions and the system has been modified to meet the
            needs of society. Today, even small jobs, for example, staff administration, also require knowledge of
            information technology for performance. That is why organizations, whether public or private, in the realm
            of human resources and information technology, modify their systems to grow, making them able to stay
            competitive.
